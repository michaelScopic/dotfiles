# Kitty

Kitty is my terminal emulator of choice. It's GPU accelerated, easy to read config (unlike alacritty), and has many built in features. 

## Features

- CaskaydiaCove NF as font 
- [Decay](https://github.com/decaycs) as color scheme
- Slightly transparent background
- More comming soon??

## Installation

(Inside the dotfiles directory...)
```sh
cp config/kitty/*.ini config/kitty/kitty.conf ~/.config/kitty
```
