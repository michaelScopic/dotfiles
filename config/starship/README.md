# Starship prompt

Starship is a shell prompt written in Rust. It aims to be very fast, customizable, and cross platform compatable.

### Note:

My rounded config is not original. It is copied from [Syndrizzle's hotfiles](https://github.com/syndrizzle/hotfiles/), but *slightly* tweaked to work with any terminal color scheme.

The plain text config is also not original. It is from Starship's offical presets.

## Installation

(Inside the dotfiles directory...)
```sh
# Use the rounded prompt
cp config/starship/rounded.toml ~/.config/starship.toml

# Use the plain text prompt
cp config/starship/plain-text-symbols.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
```
