# My Linux dotfiles [testing branch]

## NOTICE

_WARNING:_ This is the testing branch. Here, I test out new features before pushing them to `main`. Things might not function as intended, or be unstable.

This sounds scary, but really at worse all you'll experience is a script not working as intended. You most likely won't lose any data.

But still, continue at your own risk.

If you want to change to the stable branch, just run this command in the directory where you put my dotfiles

```sh
git checkout main
```
